# 📦 YOLO Checkbox Detector

The **YOLO Checkbox Detector** 🖼️ leverages the power of **YOLOv8-large** 🚀, trained extensively on a unique dataset of 10,000 diverse documents 📄, both scanned and general, to accurately detect checkboxes ✅. Our model achieves exceptional performance 🎉, significantly outperforming leading AI solutions like GPT-4 Vision and Azure Form Recognizer.

### 🌟 Model Performance
Our model was rigorously tested 🧪 on a challenging test set of 300 images. Here’s how it stacks up:

| Model                       | 📊 F1-Score |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Azure Form Recognizer**    | 0.72       |
| **GPT-4 Vision**             | 0.63       |
| **YOLO Checkbox Detector**   | **0.88**   |

With an F1-Score of 0.88, the YOLO Checkbox Detector sets a new benchmark 🌐 in checkbox detection, offering superior accuracy and reliability for document processing tasks.
